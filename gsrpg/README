 First and foremost, I must give credit to jotun for the original concept
 behind the Idle RPG. If you wish to get a more detailed summary of what
 this game is all about, please visit http://irpg.net for info
 on this particular incarnation of the Idle RPG, or http://irpg.net for
 information on the original bot and the original game.
 
 Secondly, if you have not been to http://irpg.net/ and read
 the requirements to run this bot, please do so now. The requirements for
 this game are slightly more involved than the original, and this bot will
 not function without certain dependencies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 II. Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Untar the contents of this package to the directory of your choosing. The
 following files are necessary to make GSRPG run:
   1) gsrpg.pl
   2) gsrpg.conf (or another similarly formatted config file)
   3) gsrpg.schema
   
 Once you have the contents of this package extracted, please use some kind
 of text editor to edit gsrpg.conf and ensure the settings within it are
 correct.
 
 From this point, this guide must assume several things. First, I must
 assume that you have a copy of perl (preferably 5.8.x) running, and that
 you have a database server (PostgreSQL) running. If you do not have these
 things running and are not capable of installing them, you might as well
 give up here, because you're not going to be running this bot.
 
 Third, and most importantly, you must have your database server set up
 for GSRPG to run. I strongly recommend you create your own user for GSRPG,
 and I very strongly recommend you give GSRPG its own database. If you
 need some help in doing these things, please www.postgresql.org, where you
 find some excellent documentation on configuring your database server.
 
 So, assuming you have a blank database just waiting for something to do,
 you must now import the tables and indices that GSRPG needs. These are
 found in gsrpg.schema, and you can knock out the whole thing in one
 step by taking advantage of the "psql" tool.
 
   psql -f gsrpg.schema yourdatabasename
   
 psql can take a variety of arguments (psql --help), but in order to
 properly create our database, you must pass the -f flag to force PGSQL
 to use the commands found in gsrpg.schema. Or you can go through and
 manually enter every command, but that's not much fun at all.
  
 After that, the time has come to start GSRPG. Make sure you have edited
 gsrpg.conf and that the settings found in it are accurate. If you have
 done this, then start the bot by typing:
  
   perl gsrpg.pl
 
 At this point GSRPG will be running, and your game will have officially
 started. From here on out, please consult the GSRPG website for a list
 of commands. If GSRPG does not join your channel, then please skip
 on down to the Troubleshooting section.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 III. Performance & Maintenance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Properly tuning a database server for optimal performance and maximum
 speeds is a science in and of itself and goes far beyond the scope of
 this simple README file. However, I will offer a few tips that will help
 you keep your PGSQL server running optimally.
 
  1) Disable "fsync"
     This setting can be found in postgresql.conf, and requires a reload
     to take effect. The specifics of this setting can be found on
     postgresql.org, but the result to us is that it can result in a
     performance penalty. Unless your server has a habit of random
     crashes, you will not be affected by disabling this setting.
     
  2) Run pg_autovacuum
     This is a tool that can found in the PG source tree, and must be
     compiled separately using gmake. It runs as a monitor to PG, watching
     it and "vacuuming" the database when needed. Once again the details
     of what vacumming is can be found on postgresql.org, but please note
     that you should always vacuum your databases at least once a day,
     particularly in a case like GSRPG where the database is use all the
     time. If you cannot install pg_autovacuum, then I would recommend
     setting up a cron job to vacuum on the side. Vacuuming is not
     strictly necessary, but it does go a long way towards helping your
     performance and keeping PG's resource use to a minimum.
     
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 IV. Troubleshooting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If you are having problems keeping GSRPG online, please consult your
 logfile to see any error messages the bot has produced. All error messages
 from the database and from perl itself are logged there, and they should
 provide a picture of what is wrong.
 
 You may also run GSRPG with the --debug flag, which prevents daemonizing
 and keeps you attached to the bot. You will see all incoming and outgoing
 messages, as well as any errors the bot produces.

 V. Bug Reports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Should you find a bug (and you probably will sooner or later), the best
 way to reach me is in #IRPG or #IdleRPG on irc.gamesurge.net. I'm on IRC
 most of the time and you will get the fastest response there. Failing that,
 you may email me at jake@himynameisjake.org.
