# if you want GSRPG to track netsplits (and log users out with no penalty), enable this setting.
# it attempts to check for *.net *.split and traditional netsplit messages
# NOTE: if you are on a network that does not prefix user-defined quit messages with Quit:, it
# is possible to trick GSRPG into thinking a netsplit has occurred, and thus be logged out
# with no penalty. if this is the case for you, I suggest you consider leaving this option disabled

# if you are on a network like Undernet or GameSurge that enables +x host hiding, and enables this
