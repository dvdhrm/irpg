 @ info

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + Added a line to the whoami output that will show what access an admin
   has if the user is an admin. (code by Shoat)
 + Added an 'editadmin' command that will allow you to add and remove each
   admins access.  The main admin will no longer need to directly modify 
   the database to add and revoke admin authority (code by Shoat)
 + Introduced the 'patch' file for those game admins who do not wish to 
   download and over-write their entire version of gsrpg.pl.  You may have
   to modify the patch file to work with your bot if you have made any
   custom modifications.  Making a backup beforehand is *STRONGLY* suggested.
   (This feature was created by both Shoat and Harm)
 - Edited the 'hog' command to allow admins who have the rights to summon
   an hog the ability to target the HOG to a specific player.  This was
   done to add flexibility and add opportunities for "rewards" from contests
   or other such events. (concept by hatterson, code by Shoat w/help from
   hatterson)
 - Modified the unique item names
 - Modified the list of Godsends and Calamaties to include some newer,
   more clever entries.
 - Modified the frequency that team battles occur.  Originally was an
   equasion with a variable of 1500, that variable is now 500.
 - Modified the frequency that calamaties occur.  Originally this was an
   equasion with a variable of 2000, that variable is now 1000.
 - Modified the frequency that godsends occur.  Originally this was an
   equasion with a variable of 2000, that variable is now 1000.
 - Modified the frequency that Hands of God occur.  Originally this was an
   equasion with a variable of 3000, that variable is now 1500.
 @ The version was bumped to 1.2.0 to reflect the newer line of development
   and to reflect the large number of changes and modifications by the
   current GSRPG/IRPG staff on GameSurge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.1.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + Added a password option for the monitor channel
 + Added an 'mrejoin' command to force the bot to rejoin the monitor channel
 - Modified the 'rejoin' command to not include rejoining the monitor channel

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.1.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + Added the Admin Notification channel where any admin commands issued
   to the bot will be reported in the specified channel (code by Shoat)
 + Added links to the player profiles in both the whois and lookup
   commands. (Anthony)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + Added a link to the players profile in the 'whoami' output. Please note
   that you will have to update the link to work with your site. (Kerpz|Matt)
 - Grammatical corrections made for the group quests and group battles,
   specifically the 'have have' phrase (feigling)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + Added 'rejoin' command for admins to make the bot rejoin should it be
   kicked (admin level =>5)
 + Added Foreign Keys to tables to ease deletion of players based on their
   playerid.  When a player is dropped from gsrpg_players, it deletes the
   associated entries in the other tables. (Cradly, code by Cradly)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.1.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Corrected random spelling and grammar errors
 @ Cleaned up code 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - fixed 'Can't return outside a subroutine' regarding line 113
 @ cleaned up bot source to remove some oddness in formatting 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 - the prev_online hash and the adjusting of times is now only done when
   the connection to the server is established (raw 001). this way if the
   bot can't connect to the server, everyone doesn't get logged out
 - fixed some weird typo/bug/something in quests that would never make them
   start triggering
 - recoded some things in the startup and shutdown areas so that the bot
   does not spawn a new process if it can't [re]connect to the server. it
   uses a goto loop now to go back up to the top and try again. if the
   limit specified in maxtries is reached, it terminates itself (Matt)
 + added a 'maxtries' entry to gsrpg.conf that specifies how many times the
   bot will try to connect to the irc server
 + added a 'notifymods' entry to gsrpg.conf that toggles whether the bot
   will notify players when they challenge/team battle or are affected by
   hogs/calamities/godsends/etc. this *could* cause some flooding issues,
   so if it causes problems, disable it (Jerle)
 + added a 'pidfile' entry to gsrpg.conf that creates a pid file for the
   bot on daemonization (lots of people)
 + added a 'localaddr' entry to gsrpg.conf that the bot will bind the
   socket's local ip to, if given (Matt)
 - fixed a few more grammatical errors within the bot (lots of people)
 - lowered the chances of critical strikes significantly; unique items in
   particular were being found entirely too often
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.0.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 - fixed a battle in team battles that was causing them not to be logged
   into the modifiers table (Harm)
 - fixed the pennick option in gsrpg.conf so it actually works now (Ohmer)
 - edited the regexp in checkstr() so hyphens are allowed now (ThiefMaster)
 - fixed a small bug with team battles that could help/hurt a team
   an enormous amount of time
 - fixed a typo in team battles (LadyAnn)
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.0.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 + added a checkstr() routine, which will validate all user input before
   sending any text to the database. this corrects a very nasty little
   hole in the class command, and should make for a more secure game on
   the whole
 - added in a fix to the join block because bahamut prefixes channel JOINs
   with a :, which meant that the botchan check failed and the alarm was
   never started
 + added a 'floodwatch' entry to gsrpg.conf that truncates output
   considerably (to prevent the bot from flooding off).
 + added the 'hog' command for an admin to summon the hand of god (Raiden)
 + added a fix to rpcheck() that adjust all values based on timestamps if
   the system time suddenly changes more than 30 seconds (allows for things
   like daylight savings time)
 - fixed a slight bug in find_item() that allowed you to find a unique item
   of the same type
 - added a 'noop' command for admins that makes the bot exempt a user from
   any ops/voices called by chanopvo() and massmodes()
 - changed the order of the startup commands so that you actually can
   specify an alternate config file (in place of gsrpg.conf)
 - fixed a bug with team battles that caused enormous amounts of time
   to be removed
 + created a new config system based off of .conf files
 ! completely scrapped the XML config system; after examining the
   requirements for LibXML (the perl module I was using), I decided that
   it had entirely too many dependencies, and a more traditional config
   system would serve adequately
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.0.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 + added a $modespl variable for massmodes() that is read from the server
   on connect (defaults to 6)
 - added in order by clauses to most of the modifiers to make player
   selection more random
 - fixed a slight problem with the error handling of loadconfig(). if
   config.xml (or any other config file) cannot be located, the bot
   terminates itself (rather than run on null values, which is bad)
 + added a check at the beginning of quest() to look for quests.txt. if
   the file cannot be located, quests are disabled for the next three
   hours (then the bot checks again for quests.txt).
 + added backup() sub that invokes pg_dump to back up the database every
   six hours. automatically fails if pg_dump cannot be located. also added
   an entry to config.xml to enable/disable this feature
 - added an entry to config.xml called 'botadmin'. this is the username of
   the main admin (owner) of the bot. it is granted full admin access
   upon registration. the admin level of this account also cannot be
   edited via 'chadmin'
 @ first public release of the source to the bot
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 v1.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - fixed some grammatical errors in team battle (ASk)
 + added 'lookup' command to look up info on a person by their nickname
 - the amount of time you gain/lose in team battle is now based off of a
   random percentage, instead of a set value for all 3 players. this
   corrects a problem where lower players paired with higher players could
   have enormous amounts of time subtracted from their time (effectively
   giving the low players a free level)
 - fixed a bug with manual challenges that would never increment your
   challenge timer (KcK)
 - fixed a bug with registration that caused errors when inserting records
   into the items/penalties table
 - completely redid config.xml with comments and explanantions of every
   setting. also added the option to disable any penalty (not just
   privmsg/channel/kick/etc.)
 - fixed the team battle update query to not suck anymore
 @ fixed a whole bunch of miscellaneous typos that were causing problems
 + added possibility for a random level_challenge() to rpcheck() (Jerle)
 + added an entry to config.xml to write db errors to a separate file
 - fixed the 'up' command so it actually works now (many people)
 + added an entry to config.xml to disable channel privmsg penalties (pb)
 + added an entry to config.xml to disable bot privmsg penalties (pb)
 + brought back the kick penalty, with an option to disable (many people)
 - slightly edited the register SQL statements to clean them up
 + added 'chteamdesc' command to change team descriptions
 + added 'chteampass' command to change team passwords
 + added 'chteam' command to change team names
 + added 'chadmin' command to change someone's admin acccess
 + switched the privmsg block so that commands don't have a preceding ':'
   in the name (revolution)
 + added an entry to config.xml to turn control code stripping off
 + added massmodes(), which ops/voices people who are auto-logged in when
   the bot joins the channel. if the op/voice option feature is disabled,
   so is this feature (Byte)
 - fixed a moronic bug on my part that penalized you for kicking a person
   out of the channel, instead of the person who was kicked (Harm)
 + added penalize() function to make the code cleaner (jotun)
 - switched to a timestamp-based system; time to level is calculated by
   adding the number of seconds to level to time(). this removes the two
   big update queries and takes a lot of the load off the database. made
   lots of small changes to accomodate for this. does not completely
   eradicate the timedrift problem, but should make it so that the times
   are never off by more than a second (and even that is just a chance)
