= Development information =

This project aims to create a website for the GSRPG bot. It also contains a copy
of the GSRPG project, because the upstream project is no longer actively
developed and we can bugfix and modify it here.

See TODO for a list of still to do items. If you change anything, please don't
forget to update ./TODO and add yourself in ./README to the contributors list.

== Website ==

The website in ./website/ is supposed to resemble http://irpg.php-4.info and
http://www.irpg.net. It should be recoded from scratch to avoid licensing
issues.

The website's main page is index.php. It reads config.php for user-defined
config values (if it exists) and initializes the database connection. Then it
creates the main page layout and dispatches the creation of the requested
subpage to another php script.

The page is quite simple with a single node-selection. Each node must have an
own php script which generates the HTML code for it. A node can use $db for
database queries. If $db is false, then the database connection failed and the
node should print an empty list or empty statistics or whatever it does.
See ./website/teams.php for a simple example which uses the correct layout.

See ./gsprg/gsrpg.scheme for database layout.

== GSRPG ==

The bot is copied unchanged into the ./gsrpg/ directory. It can be modified and
extended with new features if you want. However, if we want more than few simple
changes, we should probably first clean it up and split it into multiple source
files and perl modules.

== Patches ==

If you want write-access to the repository, just contact me (gix / dvdhrm). If
you are not familiar with GIT, then you can also send me patches or a link to
your modification so I can submit it to the repository.
Either send me a link on IRC or per email or a link to your own repository (svn,
cvs or whatever you wanna use) or whatever... I try to figure it out.
