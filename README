= IRPG =

This IRPG package is based in GSRPG from GameSurge. It fixes minor issus and
provides an easy to use website with statistics about the bot.

== Bot ==

Please see ./gsrpg/README for information on the bot. Minimal modifications have
been made so the original documentation is still valid for this bot.

== Website ==

Please modify ./website/index.php to your needs. It should be self-explanatory
and pretty straightforward to use.

== License ==

The original code is licensed under a BSD-style license. See below ("Original").
All modifications to this code are dedicated to the Public Domain. That is, if
you reuse this project you must adhere to the original license terms but no
additions to these are made.

The website is rewritten from scratch so everything in ./website/ is dedicated
to the Public Domain and can be used in any way you want.

This package is written by:
 - David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@googlemail.com>
