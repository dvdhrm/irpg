= TODO list =

Items that are still todo. They are sorted by importance and may include
important fixes but also just some ideas about additional features.

== Website ==

- add statistics
- dynamically retrieve sidebar stats

- Add detailed user listing. When a user is clicked and id=XY is passed as GET
  parameter, then user-details should be displayed instead of user list.

- Add detailed team listing. When a teamname is clicked and id=XY is passed as
  GET parameter, the teams.php should show details for the requested team and
  not the whole team-list.

== GSRPG ==

- Add quests
- Split perl code into multiple source files for better readability.
